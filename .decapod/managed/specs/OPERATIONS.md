# Operations## Operational Readiness Checklist
- [ ] On-call ownership defined.
- [ ] SLOs and alert thresholds defined.
- [ ] Dashboards for latency/errors/throughput are live.
- [ ] Runbooks linked for all Sev1/Sev2 alerts.
- [ ] Rollback plan validated.
- [ ] Capacity guardrails documented.## Deployment Model
Decapod is a daemonless CLI installed as a versioned Rust binary. Each invocation discovers the repository-local governance store and completes bounded work before exiting.## Installed-Version Upgrade Path
After `cargo install decapod`, the next normal governed command runs protected, idempotent schema migration and legacy-event reconciliation before runtime consumers read evidence. Existing-project `decapod init` executes the same reconciliation before regeneration. A prior successful single-datastore migration retires its JSONL inputs through a durable receipt; startup does not rescan them. Legacy SQLite stores recreated by an older binary are copied forward and removed without entering the full-backup loop. Human-authored `OVERRIDE.md` content is validated but never mechanically rewritten. Fresh import conflicts preserve source artifacts and stop with an actionable error.## Service Level Objectives
